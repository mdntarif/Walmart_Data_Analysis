## Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
Organize project folders and tools like VS Code, Python, and SQL.

### 2. Set Up Kaggle API
Download Kaggle API token and configure it to access datasets.

### 3. Download Walmart Sales Data
Use Kaggle API to download and save the dataset in the `data/` folder.

### 4. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
Install Python libraries and load data into Pandas for analysis.

### 5. Explore the Data
Analyze data structure using functions like `.info()` and `.describe()`.

### 6. Data Cleaning
Fix duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure consistent data types.

### 7. Feature Engineering
Add calculated columns like `Total Amount` for better analysis.

### 8. Load Data into PostgreSQL
Use SQLAlchemy to set up tables and load cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

### 9. SQL Analysis: Solving Business Problems
Write SQL queries to analyze trends, profitability, and customer behavior.

### 10. Project Publishing and Documentation
